## Description

This project is a Bingo application for those that play in more than one location as it can be cumbersome to move around a large Bingo Set.

## Rules

After pressing the play button on the main menu, you will be taken to the Game Menu where you can click on the next turn button that shows the next ball that has been randomly drawn. This is done one turn at a time until someone fills up their bingo card fully and the card is check against the past draws that have been made for correctness. There are 75 balls that can be drawn from 1 to 75.

## Release

There is a release for the BINGO Application in the form of a ```.msi``` installer that has been tested for windows.

## Usage 

The application is fairly simple to use. You can either download the source code and run it through the IDE of your choice or you can download the installer and run it on your windows machine. The installer will create a shortcut on your desktop that you can use to run the application.

## Images 

The images were taken from google, any other images that represent the bingo balls and a basic logo for bingo would work too.
